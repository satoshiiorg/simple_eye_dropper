## Use with asset images

Build the `EyeDropper` widget as follows:

```dart
final byteData = await rootBundle.load('asset/example.png');

(snip)
      
EyeDropper.of(
  // Encoded Uint8List.
  bytes: byteData.buffer.asUint8List(),
  // Size to display.
  size: const Size(200, 400),
  // Callback called when color is selected.
  onSelected: (color) => print('Selected color is $color'),
);
```

- `bytes` argument is a Uint8List of image bytes obtained by image_picker etc.
If `bytes` argument is null, a blank area is displayed.
- `onSelected` specifies a callback to be called when the color is selected.

## Pointer

### Choose a Pointer implementation

By default, the following pointers with magnification are specified.

```dart
EyeDropper.of(
  bytes: bytes,
  size: const Size(200, 400),
  // By default.
  pointerBuilder: MagnifierPointer.new,
  onSelected: (color) => print('Selected color is $color'),
);
```

You can also specify a simple pointer as follows:

```dart
EyeDropper.of(
  bytes: bytes,
  size: const Size(200, 400),
  // Simple small square pointer without magnification.
  pointerBuilder: (_, __) => SimplePointer(),
  onSelected: (color) => print('Selected color is $color'),
);
```

Or CircularMagnifierPointer is the following:

```dart
EyeDropper.of(
  bytes: bytes,
  size: const Size(200, 400),
  pointerBuilder: CircularMagnifierPointer.new,
  onSelected: (color) => print('Selected color is $color'),
);
```

Both of these pointers have several parameters providing for some customization.

```dart
EyeDropper.of(
  bytes: bytes,
  size: const Size(200, 400),
  // Customize the pointer with magnification.
  pointerBuilder: (uiImage, ratio) => MagnifierPointer(
    uiImage,
    ratio,
    magnification: 2.5,
    outerRectSize: 101,
    outerStrokeWidth: 3,
    innerRectSize: 9,
    innerStrokeWidth: 3,
  ),
  onSelected: (color) => print('Selected color is $color'),
);
```

### Implement Pointer

You can also create your own pointers by inheriting from `Pointer` classes.  
Refer to the code of the `CircleMagnifierPointer` class for how to implement `Pointer`.

## Image related

### Supported image formats and error handling

Supported image formats are similar to
[instantiateImageCodec](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/instantiateImageCodec.html)
function of dart:ui.  
At least the following image formats are supported: JPEG, PNG, GIF, Animated GIF, WebP,
Animated WebP, BMP, and WBMP.

When passing an unsupported image format Uint8List to `bytes`, `errorBuilder` is called.  
The usage of `errorBuilder` is the same as in
[Image.errorBuilder](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Image/errorBuilder.html).
By default, a gray error icon is displayed.

If you pass `null` for `bytes`, a blank area will be displayed.

### Use with image_picker

```dart
final picker = ImagePicker();
final image = await picker.pickImage(source: ImageSource.gallery);
if(image == null) {
  return;
}
final bytes = await image.readAsBytes();

(snip)
    
EyeDropper.of(
  bytes: bytes,
  size: const Size(200, 400),
  onSelected: (color) => print('Selected color is $color'),
);
```

In practice, you will probably use `FutureBuilder` for async/await support.  
See [example/lib/main.dart](https://github.com/satoshiiorg/simple_eye_dropper/blob/master/example/lib/main.dart)
for detailed coding examples.


### Use with network images

For example, if you use the [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http) package, you can do the following:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

(snip)

final response = await http.get(Uri.parse('https://example.org/sample.jpg'));

(snip)

EyeDropper.of(
  bytes: response.bodyBytes,
  size: const Size(200, 400),
  onSelected: (color) => print('Selected color is $color'),
);
```

Just pass the response body as is to `bytes`.

### Use with Dart Image Library

If you want to pass an image processed with [image](https://pub.dev/packages/image)
(Dart Image Library) to EyeDropper, pass a Uint8List that has been re-encoded with `img.encodeXXX`
as shown below.

```dart
import 'package:image/image.dart' as img;

(snip)

final imgImage = img.decodeImage(bytes);
final grayImage = img.grayscale(imgImage!);
grayBytes = img.encodeJpg(grayImage);

(snip)

EyeDropper.of(
  bytes: grayBytes,
  size: const Size(200, 400),
  onSelected: (color) => print('Selected color is $color'),
);
```

## Use with Riverpod

When EyeDropper is used with ConsumerWidget or ConsumerStatefulWidget of
[Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/),
the pointer may not be displayed because it is redrawn in its entirety.

```dart
// BAD example.
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

final colorProvider = StateProvider<Color>((ref) => Colors.white);

(snip)

class MyHomePage extends ConsumerWidget {

(snip)

  // Display color code.
  Text(ref.watch(colorProvider).toString()),

(snip)

}
```

In such cases, instead of using ConsumerWidget or ConsumerStatefulWidget's `ref` as is, use
[Consumer](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_riverpod/latest/flutter_riverpod/Consumer-class.html)
to specify the redraw range.

```dart
// GOOD example.
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

final colorProvider = StateProvider<Color>((ref) => Colors.white);

class MyHomePage extends ConsumerWidget {

(snip)

  // Display color code.
  Consumer(
    builder: (_, ref, __) {
      return Text(ref.watch(colorProvider).toString());
    },
  ),

(snip)

}
```
